<h1>Version 0.7.0</h1>
Look forward to a major development milestone!
With this new version, we present more than just minor bug fixes or marginal additions. 
Behind the scenes, extensive development work has been carried out, which may not be immediately apparent at first glance.

<h2>Multilanguage</h2>
A milestone is the introduction of the firmware in additional languages. The first available languages are English and Dutch.
The current release version includes the corresponding firmware files in the available language options.

<h2>Datamapping</h2>
Another important innovation involves the fundamental overhaul of data handling for connected BMS.<br>
<br>
<b>What has changed?</b><br>
Previously, the configuration defined which BMS was connected to which serial interface. This port number was then used for all further processes – whether for alarm rules, MQTT, the REST API, or internal allocation in the BMS data array.<br>
<br>
However, this led to some limitations:
<ul>
<li>The first seven storage slots were reserved for Bluetooth devices. Unused slots remained unused if no Bluetooth devices were employed.</li>
<li>The daisy-chain function was limited to Serial 2, as dictated by internal memory management.</li>
</ul>
<br>
To address these limitations, I have introduced a new mapping system:
<ol>
<li>The configuration still specifies which device is connected to which serial interface. However, for daisy-chain systems, the number of devices is no longer defined, only the assignment of, for example, which device is connected to Serial 1.</li>
<li>In a second step, one of the virtual data devices (currently there are 18) is assigned a serial interface. For daisy-chain systems, the BMS address must also be defined.</li>
</ol>
This new mapping allows the 18 storage slots to be used flexibly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
<b>Why is this important?</b><br>
Although these changes may sound simple at first, they are extremely complex in the background and affect almost all areas of the system.<br>
<br>
Moreover, this restructuring is a crucial step in preparing our system for the future.<ul>
<li>With the new flexibility in data handling, we create a foundation for the easier integration of new device types and communication protocols in the future.</li>
<li>The changes eliminate existing limitations and make our system more scalable.</li>
<li>Last but not least, we enable more efficient use of resources, which is essential for growing requirements and future developments.</li>
</ul>

<b>After the update</b>
Due to these changes, the following steps must be taken after the update to ensure the system functions properly:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Configure data mapping</b><br>
The data device mapping must be correctly set initially.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Make adjustments</b><br>
Inverters, charge control, alarm rules, ...: These must be adapted to the new data devices.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Changes to MQTT data points</b><br>
The data points have been moved from /bsc/bms/serial to /bsc/DataDevice/ID or /bsc/DataDevice/Name.</li>
</ul>
Please take these points into account to ensure smooth operation.

</ul>

<h2>Note on Bluetooth usage</h2>
Please note that in this version, <b>Bluetooth support has been removed</b>. This step was taken to improve both the <b>stability</b> and <b>performance</b> of the system.<br>
A new solution for Bluetooth is in development. It is expected to be available in the medium term and will address previous issues, enabling more stable usage.
